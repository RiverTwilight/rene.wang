Let's have a chat about something that's becoming a big deal for many people today: internet porn.

It's everywhere, super easy to access, and seems like a harmless way to explore sexuality.

But here's the catch: our brains aren’t wired to handle the endless stream of explicit content that the internet offers.

Let me explain WHY. I’ll also tell you HOW if you is addicted to porn.

## **The Dopamine Effect**

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a huge role in how we experience pleasure and motivation. It’s like the brain’s “feel-good” messenger, giving us a sense of reward when we do something enjoyable, like eating our favorite food or achieving a goal.

When it comes to sex, dopamine is released in high amounts, making it one of the most powerful natural rewards.

## The Irresistible Allure

Humans are naturally curious, and our brains love new experiences.

It’s just like how you get bored of a game, and you want find a new one (even though the new one may be worse that the previous one.)

But now, with porn just a click away, we’re constantly bombarded with high-stimulus content. This non-stop access hijacks our dopamine system, creating a constant cycle of seeking pleasure. Usually, watching porn also comes with a masturbation, which is a super dopamine booster.

**The more we watch, the more dopamine we release, and the more our brains crave it. This overload can seriously mess with our brain chemistry and behavior.**

If you keep boosting huge dopamine, you will need more and more dopamine to feel happy.

## The Pursuit of Novelty

Enter the "Coolidge Effect." This is our brain's way of saying, "Hey, new is exciting!"

When we apply this to porn, it means we're always looking for something more thrilling. This can lead to a cycle where regular content just doesn’t cut it anymore, pushing us towards more extreme material.

This explains the common patterns while consuming porn content:
- Multiple tabs
- Multiple models
- Multiple positions, dressing, narrative expectation

Over time, this pursuit of novelty can make real-life intimacy seem less exciting. **The more we rely on porn for stimulation, the harder it becomes to enjoy genuine, emotional connections with our partners.**

## The Impact on Relationships

Constant porn consumption can mess with your love life.

**It can make real sex feel less satisfying, create unrealistic expectations, and even lead to erectile dysfunction.** (You will find much proof of this on Reddit)

You might think there’s no medical link between ED and PMO, but I’m not claiming PMO directly causes ED. **You can achieve orgasm without getting hard during masturbation, but not during real sex. Your body adapts to this, leading to ED.**

Plus, extreme porn scenes set impossible standards, making us frustrated with our real-life partners.

## 3 Golden Fingers to Get Refresh

I will not give you a list-of-advice. Instead, I’ll tell you just THREE golden fingers to start.
- **Do not fear if you do *****that***** again someday.** As we discussed before, this is simulate by our body, so there is nothing to fear, feeling sad or got depressed to do that again. It’s not a failure, it’s teaching you how to get success.
- **Do a 5-min meditation every morning**. Trust me, it’s super easy, but powerful.
- **Never sexualize anything except your partner.** It’s key to your recovery, which will rewire your brain.

Follow these three rules for a month and you will thank me.

You can still masturbate, but do not use pron.

Cutting out porn might be tough at first, but the benefits—like deeper connections and a more satisfying love life—are totally worth it. Give it a shot and see how much better your relationships can be!
