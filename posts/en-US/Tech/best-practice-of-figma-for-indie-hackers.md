As an indie hacker, you don't need to use Figma like a large organization. Typically, if you're an indie hacker, you may:
- Have several websites for landing or documentation, or an all-in-one like [YGeeker](https://www.ygeeker.com/) created by me
- Have several apps. Some on iOS only, some on multiple platforms, some extensions, etc.
- Work solo most of the time. But sometimes your fans or enthusiasts help you with an icon, a page, etc.

If you're an indie like me, in this post, I'll share how I manage my team, files, and pages in Figma. This is tailored for solo makers and will boost your work efficiency.

## Pages

Your assets in Figma looks like this:

Typically we put each screen in a Frame.

It’s not recommended to put all frames in one page. Instead, use new page for a new screen. The space in the editor allows you try different ideas. Good design needs tries, tries, and retries. Besides, if a page is for a component (such as buttons), you may need to create variants for that, so it’s always a good idea to leave more space. Trust me, you won’t like navigating by dragging your pointer and find the frame in a mess.

Here’s the Newsroom page (a single page in Figma) created by my colleague for the [Newsroom](https://www.ygeeker.com/newsroom) page of YGeeker. A perfect example:

A golden test is use Notion’s Figma block. If you can clearly catch the whole page without opening it, you’re seperating pages correctly. By keeping every page minimal you can easily view them directly from notion:

Additionally, you can sort your page alphabetically for faster navigating.

## Team, Project, File

You're the only one on the team.

It's advisable to use a single team and one project for each app or website. For instance, if your app "Landmark" has an iOS client, a landing page, and a basic backend UI, you could organize them separately like this:
- Team - Joe Doe
  - Project - Documentation Site
  - Project - ClipMemo: Icons, Prototypes, Shortlisting materials, etc.
  - Project - Social Content: Your build-in-public screenshot, poster, video cover, etc.

Instead of cramming all pages and components into one Figma file, consider separating them. Just as you wouldn't put all components and hooks into a single .tsx file in a React project, use Figma's scalable file functionality to create separate, autonomous files.

Use Figma's component and variable system for quick copy-and-pasting. Need an external design system (Tailwind, MD, etc)? Drag them from your Draft to one of the project, then publish them.

What’s more, as Figma display a “Project/Filename” at the top of the editor, by doing these you can avoid naming a file too long such as “ClipMemo App”.

## Components & Varibles

Use the components you created across the team. You must add a published component to your Figma file before using it in a new design.

Using these can decrease your file size, improve consistency, and save time.

For instance, I have many products, and therefore, many icons. I need to reuse them in areas such as:
- Listing all products on the Discover page of YGeeker
- Promoting A on the about page of B
- Placing icons on a social media cover image

Therefore, it's practical to make a component for each logo/icon.

## Recap
- Keep frame count minimal in one page
- Keep files as small and nimble as possible
- Each product takes a project
- Prefer Figma’s component & variable system
- Create component for each product icon
